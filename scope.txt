----------------- for each canada email being deployed to prod:

-create the sendable data extension
-create the sentlog data extension
-create the sendable query
-create the sentlog query
-create the email
-create the user initiated send definition
-create the automation

---------------- notes about this deployment:

-for canada queries, let's validate the record type id's on the accounts (sold-to and ship-to are what we expect them to be in the queries)
-for canada std sentlog queries - it would be good later on to change these to the simple select * from sendableDE queries like RMA uses
-keep an eye on the shipment emails (us/ca) and how we added the order-by order-id piece
***unpause canada automations after new fields have been added to FromSAP_Order/Shipment/Invoice data extensions
-look into us rma dealer shipping email (doesn't have the consumed=0 piece in shipment rows lookup - may be showing too much shipment rows)
-doing internationalorders@yeti.com as from-email and reply-to for canada consumer rma order/ship
-consider adding conditional send steps to automations (test in sandbox first)
-clean up foldering for tracking/sends of dealer tx messages in production

---------------- next steps:

-monday night: SAP deployment, add columns to FromSAP DE's in SFMC
-wed night: smoke test
-next monday: go live!
